Looking at that response, no, this doesn't look right. That's an HTML document response instead of JSON, which suggests there's an issue with your webhook endpoint.
The response shows a full HTML page (looks like a Vite development server page for "Converse Insurance - Document Processing Platform") rather than the expected JSON response from your webhook.
Possible issues:

Wrong URL - The HTTP node might be hitting the wrong endpoint (maybe hitting your frontend instead of /api/webhook/n8n-completion)
Server not running - Your backend server might not be running, so requests are falling back to the frontend
Routing issue - The webhook endpoint might not be properly configured in your API
CORS/networking - The request might be getting redirected

To debug:

Check your HTTP node URL - Make sure it's pointing to the correct API endpoint:
https://your-backend-domain.com/api/webhook/n8n-completion

Test the endpoint directly - Try a quick curl test:
bashcurl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/n8n-completion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'

Check your backend logs - See if the webhook endpoint is being hit at all
Verify the endpoint exists - Make sure your /api/webhook/n8n-completion route is properly set up and running

The HTML response suggests the request is hitting your frontend app instead of your backend API.RetryHWthis is my endpointhttps://db59eecd-7dcd-4e12-a7ea-047fe8f08497-00-2h9g2oppbu6bq.riker.replit.dev/api/webhook/n8n-completion

Issue Identified: Replit Development URL Problems
Your endpoint is returning HTML because:

Development URL Limitations - Replit development URLs can be unreliable for external webhook calls, especially POST requests DEV Communityreplit
Not Deployed - The URL you're using appears to be a development environment, but POST requests to API routes often don't work properly until deployed Stripe API Integration Deployment - Replit
Route Handling - The endpoint might not be properly configured to handle POST requests
