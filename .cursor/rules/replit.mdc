# Replit Development Guidelines

## **Server Management**
- **DO NOT start local development servers** using `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or similar commands when working on Replit
- Replit provides its own hosting environment that automatically serves the application
- The user will test and run the application through Replit's frontend interface
- Only start servers locally if explicitly requested by the user for debugging purposes

## **Configuration**
- **Vite and Express server configurations** must include Replit domain allowedHosts:
  - Current domain: `db59eecd-7dcd-4e12-a7ea-047fe8f08497-00-2h9g2oppbu6bq.riker.replit.dev`
  - Wildcard: `.replit.dev`
  - Standard: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`

## **Environment Variables**
- Use **Replit Secrets** for sensitive data like AWS credentials
- Configure secrets in the Replit interface, not in local `.env` files
- Backend environment variables should be accessible through Replit's environment

## **Port Management**
- **Default ports**: 
  - Backend/Express: 5000 (as configured in server/index.ts)
  - Frontend/Vite: 5173 (as configured in vite.config.ts)
- Avoid port conflicts by ensuring only one instance runs at a time
- Use `pkill -f tsx` or similar to clean up processes if needed

## **File Operations**
- Be cautious with file deletion commands
- Always verify file paths before making changes
- Use version control (git) to track changes on Replit

## **Testing Approach**
- User will test through Replit's hosted frontend
- Focus on configuration fixes rather than local testing
- Provide guidance for using Replit's built-in tools and console
